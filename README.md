Generating Texts and Images using Various Transformer Models that I try to perform by learning and by doing self projects

1) VAE : Images are generated with best output from Fashion Mnist dataset
2) VAE using CelebA : Similar to VAE but used CelebA Dataset
3) LSTM : Generated text results for Epirecipes that is recipes by entering prompts
4) DCGAN : Generated Real and Fake Images prediction of Lego Bricks Dataset
5) PixelCNN : Generating Extra Pixels in Images
